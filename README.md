# Reconstruction-of-Trajectory

The goal of this project is to use the preprocessed static data set to reconstruct a fairly complex vehicle trajectory.

The Input data has 4 variables i.e,
  * Timestamp
  * Displacement
  * Yaw rate
  * Acceleration

#### The data set can be seen below,

**`timestamp`** - Timestamps are all measured in seconds. The time between successive timestamps **Δt** will always be the same within a trajectory's data set (but not between data sets).

**`displacement`** - Displacement data from the odometer is in meters and gives the **total** distance traveled up to this point.

**`yaw_rate`** - Yaw rate is measured in radians per second with the convention that positive yaw corresponds to **counter-clockwise** rotation. 

**`acceleration`** - Acceleration is measured in m/s2 and is always in the direction of motion of the vehicle (forward). 

### Solution

Here I have created four functions named,
* `get_speeds` - returns a length $N$ list where entry $i$ contains the speed ($m/s$) of the vehicle at $t = i \times \Delta t$ 

* `get_headings` - returns a length $N$ list where entry $i$ contains the heading (radians, $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$) of the vehicle at $t = i \times \Delta t$

* `get_x_y` - returns a length $N$ list where entry $i$ contains an `(x, y)` tuple corresponding to the $x$ and $y$ coordinates (meters) of the vehicle at $t = i \times \Delta t$ 

* `show_x_y` - generates an x vs. y scatter plot of vehicle positions.
